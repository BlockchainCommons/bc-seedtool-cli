# üå± Blockchain Commons bc-seedtool-cli

A tool for creating and transforming cryptographic seeds.

## Dependencies

* [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base)
* [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir)
* [`bc-slip39`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-slip39)
* [`bc-bip39`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-bip39)
* [`bc-ur`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-ur)
* [`GNU argp`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html)
* [`CBOR Lite`](https://bitbucket.org/isode/cbor-lite)

## Installation

These dependencies are automatically installed as submodules when you run the build script. This is the recommended way to install.

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

## Alternative Installation

This sequence does *not* install the dependencies from submodules; instead they must be installed in the usual places on the build system, otherwise the `./configure` step below will fail.

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Incremental Builds

If you wish to make changes to the source code and rebuild:

```bash
# Make source changes
$ source set_build_paths.sh # sets shell variables used by make
$ make clean # If you want a clean build
$ make
```

## Use

```
$ seedtool
8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8

$ seedtool --in hex --out bip39 8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8
matrix pull accuse apart horn chat next rifle resemble artist until eye

$ seedtool --in bip39 matrix pull accuse apart horn chat next rifle resemble artist until eye
8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8
```

```
$ seedtool --help
```

See [`MANUAL.md`](MANUAL.md) for detail, examples, and version history.

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ make check
$ make distclean
```

### Known Issues

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Lack of Round-trip Compatibility between BIP-39 and SLIP-39

At first glance, BIP-39 and SLIP-39 both appear to be means of converting a binary seed to a set of backup words and back. You might assume you could simply convert a BIP-39 backup to a binary seed, from that binary seed to SLIP-39, and then use the SLIP-39 backup to recover the same wallet as the original BIP-39 backup, but this is **NOT** the case. This is because the SLIP-39 algorithm that SatoshiLabs uses in their Trezor wallet does not derive the master secret in the same way as their BIP-39 algorithm does.

Currently Blockchain Commons is investigating an alternative to SLIP-39 that allows round-trips with BIP-39. We want to ensure that the same seed will result in the same derived keys using either BIP-39 or our alternative approach.

As SLIP-39 is not round-trip compatible with BIP-39, and SLIP-39 is under the control of SatoshiLabs and does not appear to be a fully community-controlled standard, Blockchain Commons is no longer endorsing SLIP-39.

* This issue is being tracked [here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit/issues/38).
