# ðŸŒ± Blockchain Commons bc-seedtool-cli

## Introduction

`seedtool` is a command-line tool for creating and transforming cryptographic seeds of the sort commonly used by blockchain applications. Here are a few examples of use:

### Generate a cryptographically-strong 16-byte seed

```
$ seedtool
8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8
```

### Encode the above seed as BIP-39

```
$ seedtool --in hex --out bip39 8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8
matrix pull accuse apart horn chat next rifle resemble artist until eye
```

### Decode the above BIP-39 back to hex

```
$ seedtool --in bip39 "matrix pull accuse apart horn chat next rifle resemble artist until eye"
8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8
```

### Decode a seed encoded by Bytewords back to hex

```
$ seedtool --in btw "deli need cats taxi dice door webs vows free zest legs wall half waxy trip oval memo sets rock hill"
279b18d0282aefe845fb83e956eed8a6
```

### Generate a seed using entropy provided as coin flips

```
$ seedtool --in bits 1110110001110111
8d933e43b1bc8f2e3fc27adc98ad4534
```

### Generate a 32-byte seed using entropy provided as cards drawn from a deck of playing cards

```
$ seedtool --count 32 --in cards 6c9s8c7c9c4cah6c2sjs7d5c2s4c4dqs
7df301924511326d7350be14c9e7176d98e945f9ad0ed034726ad4ee0de59c25
```

### Generate a 16-byte seed and encode it using SSKR as 3 shares, 2 of which are required for recovery

```
$ seedtool --out sskr --group 2-of-3
tuna acid epic gyro edge twin able acid able yoga nail wand keno paid ruin jazz keys acid time film pool skew flew luck ruby song owls soap obey
tuna acid epic gyro edge twin able acid acid yell omit mild webs warm epic flew liar view fuel deli fund glow skew dull knob claw gray surf wand
tuna acid epic gyro edge twin able acid also visa wave bulb hope drum quad duty need tied vast barn kick task gray tent crux owls easy jolt toil
```

### Recover the above seed using 2 of the 3 shares

```
$ seedtool --in sskr
tuna acid epic gyro edge twin able acid able yoga nail wand keno paid ruin jazz keys acid time film pool skew flew luck ruby song owls soap obey
tuna acid epic gyro edge twin able acid also visa wave bulb hope drum quad duty need tied vast barn kick task gray tent crux owls easy jolt toil

```

### Generate a seed, encode it as UR, transform it to upper case, display it on the console, and encode it to a QR Code in the file "seedqrcode.png"

```
$ seedtool --ur | tr [:lower:] [:upper:] | tee /dev/tty | qrencode -o seedqrcode.png -l L
UR:CRYPTO-SEED/OEADGDHHGTPKFXLGHHLBPYMHLFRYHLPLSSRKPKAOTPIECFFDENTNJNWNPF
```

### Generate a 64-byte seed using a deterministic random number generator and encode it as a multi-part UR with a maximum fragment size of 20 bytes

```
$ seedtool --deterministic=TEST --count 64 --ur=20
ur:crypto-seed/1-4/ltadaacsgecyuywdrnesguoeadhdfznteelblrcygldwvarflojtcywyjytpfsmdidpk

ur:crypto-seed/4-4/ltaaaacsgecyuywdrnesguwsdpgtimmwzspfqdjkhshyaotpiecffdemaeaedmnsoxhf
```

### Same as above, but generate 5 additional parts using fountain codes

```
$ seedtool --deterministic=TEST --count 64 --ur=20 --parts 5
ur:crypto-seed/1-4/ltadaacsgecyuywdrnesguoeadhdfznteelblrcygldwvarflojtcywyjytpfsmdidpk

## Installation

These dependencies are automatically installed as submodules when you run the build script. This is the recommended way to install.

### MacOS

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

### Linux

Make sure you have llvm/clang, libc++ and libc++abi installed. All of them with
a minimum recommended version 10.

#### Ubuntu and Debian

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install make

$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ sudo ./llvm.sh 10  # version 10

$ sudo apt-get install libc++-10-dev libc++abi-10-dev
```

```bash
$ export CC="clang-10" && export CXX="clang++-10" && ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

### Windows

See [instructions here](Windows.md).

## Alternative Installation

This sequence does *not* install the dependencies from submodules; instead they must be installed in the usual places on the build system, otherwise the `./configure` step below will fail.

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
*Note:* On Linux the first step is `./configure CC=clang-10 CXX=clang++-10`

## Incremental Builds

If you wish to make changes to the source code and rebuild:

```bash
# Make source changes
$ source set_build_paths.sh # sets shell variables used by make
$ make clean # If you want a clean build
$ make
```

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ make check
$ make distclean
```
